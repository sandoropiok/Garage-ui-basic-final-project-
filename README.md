# Garage Website

**Garage Website** is the final project in my UI Basic course at the Digital Career Institute (DCI). This website serves as a platform for classic and vintage car enthusiasts, offering a curated selection of vehicles for sale, along with captivating stories about their history and restoration. The project showcases the skills I've developed in HTML and CSS, focusing on creating a responsive, user-friendly interface that captures the elegance and nostalgia of the automotive world. This project reflects my learning journey and serves as a testament to my growing expertise in web design.
